# 🧠 Readlog: JavaScript Modal Window Project

---

## 🪄 Overview
This project is a simple **modal window** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It demonstrates how to make a webpage interactive using **DOM manipulation**, **event listeners**, and **CSS class toggling**.

The goal was to learn how to control user interface components dynamically through JavaScript.

---

## 🧩 Files Created

### 1. `index.html`
- Created the main structure of the webpage.  
- Added three buttons to open the modal (`.show-modal`).  
- Added a `.modal` container with text and a close button (`.close-modal`).  
- Added an `.overlay` background for the modal effect.  
- Linked external CSS and JavaScript files.

**Key takeaway:** Learned how HTML structure connects with JavaScript via `class` selectors.

---

### 2. `style.css`
- Designed the modal window and background overlay.
- Used gradients for a modern background.
- Styled buttons, text, and the modal box.
- Added a `.hidden` class to hide elements dynamically.

**Key takeaway:**  
Learned how CSS classes like `.hidden` can control visibility, and how JavaScript can add/remove them for smooth effects.

---

### 3. `script.js`
- Implemented all the JavaScript logic for opening and closing the modal.

#### 🧱 Concepts Practiced:
- `querySelector()` — selects the **first** matching HTML element.
- `querySelectorAll()` — selects **all** matching elements.
- `addEventListener()` — makes elements respond to events (like `click` or `keydown`).
- `classList.add()` / `classList.remove()` — shows or hides elements by toggling CSS classes.
- `for` loops — used to attach the same event to multiple elements.
- `keydown` event — detects when the **Escape key** is pressed to close the modal.

#### ✨ Features Implemented:
- Modal opens when any `.show-modal` button is clicked.  
- Modal closes when:
  - The **X** button is clicked  
  - The **overlay** is clicked  
  - The **Escape key** is pressed

**Key takeaway:**  
Learned how JavaScript can directly manipulate the DOM to create dynamic, interactive web components.

## 💬 Reflection
This was a great beginner-friendly project that helped me understand the fundamentals of **DOM manipulation** and **interactivity** in JavaScript.  
Even though it’s simple, it’s the foundation for features like popups, alerts, and custom UI components in real-world web apps.

---

## 🪄 Next Steps
- Add animations for the modal using CSS transitions.
- Add accessibility features (like focus trapping).
- Experiment with multiple modals on one page.
